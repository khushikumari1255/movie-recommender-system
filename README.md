. Select a movie and get similar recommendations
. Fast recommendations using precomputed similarity matrix
. Simple and interactive Streamlit interface
. Works offline after setup

-Technologies Used

.Python

- How It Works
. Movie data is cleaned and processed
. Important features are combined into text representation
. Vectorization is applied on movie features
. Cosine similarity is calculated between movies
. Based on similarity, top matching movies are recommended

- How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system.git
cd movie-recommender-system

2. Install required libraries
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn

3. Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py

- Example
